Please follow the structure of this template when preparing your proposal. It has been designed to ensure that the important aspects of your planned work are presented in a way that will enable the experts to make an effective assessment against the evaluation criteria. Sections 1, 2 and 3 each correspond to an evaluation criterion for a full proposal.

Please be aware that proposals will be evaluated as they were submitted, rather than on their potential if certain changes were to be made. This means that only proposals that successfully address all the required aspects will have a chance of being funded. There will be no possibility for significant changes to content, budget and consortium composition during grant preparation.

\textbf{First stage proposals:} In two-stage submission schemes, at the first stage you only need to complete the parts indicated by a bracket (i.e. \}). These are in the cover page, and sections 1 and 2.

\textbf{Page limit:} \uline{For full proposals, the cover page, and sections 1, 2 and 3, together should not be longer than 70 pages}. All tables in these sections must be included within this limit. The minimum font size allowed is 11 points. The page size is A4, and all margins (top, bottom, left, right) should be at least 15 mm (not including any footers or headers).

\uline{The page limit for a first stage proposal is 10 pages.}
The page limit will be applied automatically; therefore you must remove this instruction page before submitting.

If you attempt to upload a proposal longer than the specified limit, before the deadline you will receive an automatic warning, and will be advised to shorten and re-upload the proposal. After the deadline, any excess pages will be overprinted with a 'watermark', indicating to evaluators that these pages must be disregarded.

Please do not consider the page limit as a target! It is in your interest to keep your text as concise as possible, since experts rarely view unnecessarily long proposals in a positive light.

\section{Ethics and Security}

\eucommentary{This section is not covered by the page limit.}

\subsection{Ethics}

\eucommentary{
If you have entered any ethics issues in the ethical issue table in the administrative proposal forms, you must:\\
$\bullet$ submit an ethics self-assessment, which: \\
-- describes how the proposal meets the national legal and ethical requirements of the
country or countries where the tasks raising ethical issues are to be carried out;\\
-- explains in detail how you intend to address the issues in the ethical issues table, in
particular as regards:
research objectives (e.g. study of vulnerable populations, dual use, etc.),
research methodology (e.g. clinical trials, involvement of children and related
consent procedures, protection of any data collected, etc.),
the potential impact of the research (e.g. dual use issues, environmental damage,
stigmatisation of particular social groups, political or financial retaliation,
benefit-sharing, malevolent use , etc.)\\
$\bullet$ provide the documents that you need under national law (if you already have them), e.g.:\\
-- an ethics committee opinion;\\
-- the document notifying activities raising ethical issues or authorizing such activities}

\eucommentary{If these documents are not in English, you must also submit an English summary of them (containing, if available, the conclusions of the committee or authority concerned).}

\eucommentary{If you plan to request these documents specifically for the project
you are proposing, your request must contain an explicit reference to the project title.}

\subsection[Security]{Security\protect\footnote{Article 37.1 of the Model Grant Agreement: Before disclosing results of activities raising security issues to a third party (including affiliated entities), a beneficiary must inform the coordinator ? which must request written approval from the Commission/Agency. Article 37.2: Activities related to ?classified deliverables? must comply with the ?security requirements? until they are declassified. Action tasks related to classified deliverables may not be subcontracted without prior explicit written approval from the Commission/Agency. The beneficiaries must inform the coordinator ? which must immediately inform the Commission/Agency ? of any changes in the security context and ? if necessary ? request for Annex 1 to be amended (see Article 55)}} 

Please indicate if your proposal will involve:

\begin{compactitem}
\item activities or results raising security issues: NO
\item 'EU-classified information' as background or results: NO
\end{compactitem}
