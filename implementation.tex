\subsection{Project work plan}
\label{sec:wp}

\eucommentary{Please provide the following:
\begin{compactitem}
\item brief presentation of the overall structure of the work plan;
\item timing of the different work packages and their components (Gantt chart or
  similar);
\item detailed work description, i.e.:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item a description of each work package (table 3.1a);
  \item a list of work packages (table 3.1b);
  \item a list of major deliverables (table 3.1c);
  \end{compactitem}
\item graphical presentation of the components showing how they inter-relate (Pert
  chart or similar).
\end{compactitem}}


\eucommentary{Give full details. Base your account on the logical structure of the project and
the stages in which it is to be carried out. Include details of the resources to
be allocated to each work package. The number of work packages should be
proportionate to the scale and complexity of the project.}


\eucommentary{You should give enough detail in each work package to justify the proposed
resources to be allocated and also quantified information so that progress can
be monitored, including by the Commission.}


\eucommentary{You are advised to include a distinct work package on 'management' (see section 3.2) and to give due visibility in the work plan to 'dissemination and exploitation' and 'communication activities', either with distinct tasks or distinct work packages.}


\eucommentary{You will be required to include an updated (or confirmed) 'plan for the
dissemination and exploitation of results' in both the periodic and final
reports. (This does not apply to topics where a draft plan was not required.)
This should include a record of activities related to dissemination and
exploitation that have been undertaken and those still planned. A report of
completed and planned communication activities will also be required.}


\eucommentary{If your project is taking part in the Pilot on Open Research Data, you must include a 'data management plan' as a distinct deliverable within the first 6 months of the project. A template for such a plan is given in the guidelines on data management in the H2020 Online Manual. This deliverable will evolve during the lifetime of the project in order to present the status of the project's reflections on data management.}


\eucommentary{\\
\textbf{Definitions:}
\begin{compactitem}
\item \uline{'Work package'} means a major sub-division of the proposed project.
\item \uline{'Deliverable'} means a distinct output of the project, meaningful in terms of the project's overall objectives and constituted by a report, a document, a technical diagram, a software etc.
\end{compactitem}
}

\subsection{Management structure, milestones and procedures}

\eucommentary{
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Describe the organisational structure and the decision-making (including a list of milestones (table 3.2a)) .
\item Explain why the organisational structure and decision-making mechanisms are appropriate to the complexity and scale of the project.
\item Describe, where relevant, how effective innovation management will be addressed in the management structure and work plan.
  \end{compactitem}}
  
\eucommentary{  
\emph{Innovation management is a process which requires an understanding of both market and technical problems, with a goal of successfully implementing appropriate creative ideas. A new or improved product, service or process is its typical output. It also allows a consortium to respond to an external or internal opportunity.}}

\eucommentary{
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the stated project's objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk mitigation measures. Please provide a table with critical risks identified and mitigating actions (table 3.2b)\end{compactitem}}


\eucommentary{\\
\textbf{Definitions:}
\begin{compactitem}
\item[] \uline{'Milestones'} means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development.
\end{compactitem}
}

\subsection{Consortium as a whole}

\eucommentary{The individual members of the consortium are described in a
  separate section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here.\\
%
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Describe the consortium. How will it match the project?s objectives, and bring together the necessary expertise? How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate),?
  \item In what way does each of them contribute to the project? Show that each has a valid role, and adequate resources in the project to fulfil that role.
  \item If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the project to ensure exploitation of the results and explain why this is consistent with and will help to achieve the specific measures which are proposed for exploitation of the results of the project (see section 2.2).
  \item \textbf{Other countries and international organisations:} If one or more of the participants requesting EU funding is based in a country or is an international organisation that is not automatically eligible for such funding (entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries and from one of the countries in the exhaustive list included in General Annex A of the work programme are automatically eligible for EU funding), explain why the participation of the entity in question is essential to carrying out the project
  \end{compactitem}

\subsection{Resources to be committed}

\eucommentary{
  Please make sure the information in this section matches the costs as stated
  in the budget table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms, and the
  number of person/months, shown in the detailed work package descriptions.}

\eucommentary{
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item a table showing number of person/months required (table 3.4a)
  \item a table showing 'other direct costs' (table 3.4b) for participants where
    those costs exceed 15\% of the personnel costs (according to the budget
    table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms)
  \end{compactitem}
}
